## What I Learned

## What I learned

Back to basics after being away from development for almost 1 year. This challenge was about muscle memory more than learning - just getting comfortable with writing CSS and HTML again.

## Continued development

I'm using Frontend Mentor challenges to systematically refresh my skills and build coding discipline. Looking forward to tackling more complex layouts, animations, and eventually moving into JavaScript-heavy projects. The goal is to rebuild momentum and establish consistent coding habits before diving into larger applications.
